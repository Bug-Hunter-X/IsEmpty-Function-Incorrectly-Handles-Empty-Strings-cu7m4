This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty` function.  The `IsEmpty` function is intended to check if a variable is uninitialized or contains a null value. However, it does not correctly handle empty strings (strings with zero length).  The provided example shows how this can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when performing arithmetic operations. The solution demonstrates a robust alternative approach that accurately handles empty strings and other potential edge cases.
